# 1) Clone linux kernel
# 2) create folder called image
# 3) copy launch_qemu script to root of linux
# 4) copy create_image script to image folder


5) build linux kernel
6) cd image && ./create_image
7) cd ..
8) ./launch_qemu
9) I dunno

If you want to move benchmarks to the image either build in qemu, or copy them to the image before itâ€™s created (bottom of the ./create_image script there is an example of moving some mcf spec files into the image).

Any changes to the kernel will require redoing this process from step 5 excluding step 9.
